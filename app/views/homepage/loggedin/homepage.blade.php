Content goes here ya bish. I couldn't put icons for the menu items cause I didn't have the icons from da design but iss all good, we do em later. This is the layout and feel for what it will look like when a user is logged in. Other pages will show up when the user is not logged in. I will finalize those pages in the coming week.<br />
